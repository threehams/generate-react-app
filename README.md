# generate-react-app

I'm tired of making example apps to test libraries.
This will generate a working app of any size, filled with as many junk components with as much fake data as you'd like.

Possible future features include:

- Flow support
- support for untyped projects (what are you thinking?)
- runtime errors injected in random places
- chaotic indirection, random prop renaming
- plugin system for templates
- mock backend API
- mock GraphQL API
- test generation (I want this to work for any site)
- conditional template rendering
- interactive elements (panels, buttons, forms)
